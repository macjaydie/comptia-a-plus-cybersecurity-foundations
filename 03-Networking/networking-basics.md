# Networking Basics



This document introduces the fundamental concepts of computer networking. Networking knowledge is essential in cybersecurity because most attacks and defenses involve systems communicating over a network.

## What Is a Network



A network is a group of devices connected together to share data and resources.



Examples of networked devices:

- Computers

- Servers

- Routers

- Printers

- Smartphones



Networks allow communication between systems locally and across the internet.

## Types of Networks



### LAN (Local Area Network)

A network within a small area like a home, school, or office.



### WAN (Wide Area Network)

A network that covers large geographic areas. The internet is the largest WAN.



### WLAN (Wireless LAN)

A LAN that uses Wi-Fi instead of cables.

## IP Addresses



An IP address is a unique identifier assigned to a device on a network.



Two common versions:

- IPv4 (e.g., 192.168.1.10)

- IPv6 (longer format for more addresses)



IP addresses help devices find and communicate with each other.

## MAC Addresses



A MAC address is a physical address assigned to a network interface card (NIC).



It is used for communication within the local network.



Unlike IP addresses, MAC addresses are tied to hardware.

## Routers and Switches



### Switch

Connects devices within a local network and forwards data to the correct device.



### Router

Connects different networks together and directs traffic between them, including to the internet.



Routers often provide firewall and security features.

## Ports and Protocols



Devices communicate using protocols and port numbers.



Examples:

- HTTP (web traffic)

- HTTPS (secure web traffic)

- FTP (file transfer)

- DNS (domain name resolution)



Understanding ports and protocols helps identify normal vs suspicious traffic.

## Why Networking Matters in Cybersecurity



Most cyber attacks travel across networks.



Security professionals use networking knowledge to:

- Monitor traffic

- Detect intrusions

- Investigate suspicious connections

- Configure firewalls and security tools
