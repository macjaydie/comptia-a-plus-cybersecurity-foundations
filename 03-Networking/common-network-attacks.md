# Common Network Attacks



This document outlines common types of attacks that occur over networks. Understanding these threats helps security professionals detect, prevent, and respond to malicious activity.



---



## Phishing



Phishing is a social engineering attack where attackers trick users into revealing sensitive information such as passwords or financial details.



Phishing often occurs through:

- Fake emails

- Malicious links

- Spoofed websites



---



## Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)



A MitM attack occurs when an attacker secretly intercepts communication between two parties.



This can allow attackers to:

- Steal credentials

- Read sensitive data

- Modify communications



MitM attacks often occur on unsecured Wi-Fi networks.



---



## Denial-of-Service (DoS)



A DoS attack attempts to overwhelm a system, server, or network so that legitimate users cannot access it.



A Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack uses many systems to launch the attack simultaneously.



---



## Brute Force Attacks



In a brute force attack, an attacker repeatedly tries different password combinations until the correct one is found.



Strong passwords and account lockout policies help defend against these attacks.



---



## Packet Sniffing



Packet sniffing involves capturing network traffic to analyze data being transmitted.



Attackers may use sniffing to:

- Capture login credentials

- Monitor unencrypted communications



Encryption (HTTPS, VPNs) helps prevent data from being readable.

## Why Understanding Network Attacks Matters



Security teams must recognize how attackers operate in order to detect and stop them.



Knowledge of these attacks helps defenders:

- Monitor network traffic effectively

- Configure firewalls and IDS/IPS tools

- Train users to recognize threats
