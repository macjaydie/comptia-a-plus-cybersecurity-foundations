# Basic Network Security Concepts



This document introduces fundamental network security concepts that are used to protect systems and data as they travel across networks. Understanding these controls is essential for detecting and preventing cyber attacks.

## Firewalls



A firewall is a security device or software that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined rules.



Firewalls help:

- Block unauthorized access

- Allow legitimate traffic

- Prevent attackers from reaching internal systems



Firewalls can be:

- Hardware-based (network firewalls)

- Software-based (host firewalls like Windows Defender Firewall)

## Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)



An IDS monitors network traffic for suspicious activity and alerts administrators when potential threats are detected.



Key point:

- IDS detects but does not automatically block traffic



IDS tools are useful for identifying:

- Malware communication

- Port scans

- Unusual traffic patterns



---



## Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)



An IPS performs the same monitoring as an IDS but can also take action to block or stop malicious traffic.



Key point:

- IPS can automatically prevent attacks in real time



---



## Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)



A VPN creates a secure, encrypted connection between a user and a network over the internet.



VPNs help protect:

- Data from being intercepted

- Remote workers connecting to company systems

- Sensitive information on public Wi-Fi



---



## Network Segmentation



Network segmentation divides a network into smaller sections to limit the spread of attacks.



Benefits:

- Reduces attacker movement

- Protects sensitive systems

- Improves monitoring and control



For example, separating user devices from servers adds an extra layer of defense.

## Why Network Security Matters in Cybersecurity



Most cyber attacks travel across networks. Security professionals must understand how traffic is filtered, monitored, and protected.



These controls help defenders:

- Detect intrusions

- Block malicious activity

- Protect sensitive systems

- Reduce the impact of breaches
