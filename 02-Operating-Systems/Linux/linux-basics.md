# Linux Basics



This document introduces the fundamentals of the Linux operating system. Linux is widely used in servers, enterprise systems, and cybersecurity environments.

## What Is Linux



Linux is an open-source operating system based on Unix principles. It is known for its stability, flexibility, and strong security model.



Linux is commonly used in:

- Web servers

- Cloud infrastructure

- Networking equipment

- Cybersecurity tools

## Linux Distributions



A Linux distribution (distro) is a packaged version of Linux with software and tools.



Examples include:

- Ubuntu

- Debian

- Fedora

- Kali Linux



Although they differ in purpose, they share the same core operating system structure.

## Linux File System Structure



Linux uses a hierarchical file system starting from the root directory `/`.



Important directories:

- `/home` – User directories

- `/etc` – System configuration files

- `/var` – Logs and variable data

- `/bin` – Essential command binaries

- `/root` – Home directory of the root user



Understanding these locations is important for administration and security investigations.

## Users and Permissions



Linux is a multi-user system with strict permission controls.



Each file and folder has permissions for:

- Owner

- Group

- Others



Permission types:

- Read (r)

- Write (w)

- Execute (x)



The **root** user has full control over the system.

## Command Line Importance



Linux systems are often managed through the command line interface (CLI).



The terminal allows users and administrators to:

- Manage files

- Configure the system

- Monitor processes

- Control permissions



Command line knowledge is essential in cybersecurity roles.

## Why Linux Matters in Cybersecurity



Linux is heavily used in:

- Security tools

- Servers hosting applications

- Network infrastructure



Security professionals must understand Linux to:

- Investigate server incidents

- Analyze logs

- Secure systems

- Understand attacker techniques
