# Windows Logging and Event Viewer



## Why Logs Matter

Logs are one of the most important data sources in cybersecurity.

They provide visibility into what is happening on a system and are

essential for detecting attacks, investigating incidents, and

troubleshooting system issues.



In Blue Team and SOC roles, logs are often more important than tools.

If an event is not logged, it is difficult or impossible to prove that

an action occurred.

## What Is Event Viewer

Event Viewer is a built-in Windows tool used to view and analyze system

logs. These logs record system activity, user actions, application

events, and security-related activity.



Event Viewer helps administrators and security analysts:

- Identify system errors

- Detect suspicious activity

- Investigate failed logins

- Understand system behavior over time

## Main Windows Log Categories



### Application Log

The Application log records events generated by applications and

software components.



Examples include:

- Application crashes

- Failed application startups

- Software errors



These logs are useful when troubleshooting application-level issues.



---



### System Log

The System log records events related to the operating system and core

system components.



Examples include:

- Driver failures

- Service start and stop events

- System shutdowns and restarts



System logs help determine whether issues are caused by hardware,

drivers, or OS components.

### Security Log

The Security log is the most important log for cybersecurity.



It records:

- Successful and failed login attempts

- Account lockouts

- Privilege escalation events

- Object access (if auditing is enabled)



Security logs are heavily used in:

- Incident response

- Threat detection

- User behavior analysis

## Important Security Events (Conceptual)



Examples of events defenders commonly monitor:

- Multiple failed login attempts (possible brute force attack)

- Logins outside normal hours

- Use of administrator privileges

- Creation of new user accounts

- Services created or modified unexpectedly



Understanding *why* these events matter is more important than

memorizing event ID numbers at this stage.

## Logs and Incident Response

During an incident, logs help answer key questions:

- What happened?

- When did it happen?

- Which user or process was involved?

- How did the system respond?



Logs provide the timeline needed for proper investigation and recovery.

## Why This Matters for Blue Team Roles

Blue Team analysts rely on logs to detect and respond to threats.

SIEM tools, EDR platforms, and SOC dashboards all depend on log data

collected from endpoints like Windows systems.



Strong understanding of Windows logs is a foundational skill for any

cybersecurity defender.
