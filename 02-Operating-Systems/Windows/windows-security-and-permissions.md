# Windows Security and Permissions

## User Accounts in Windows
Windows uses user accounts to control access to the system.
The two primary account types are:
- Standard User
- Administrator

Standard users have limited permissions, while administrators can make system-wide changes.

---

## Principle of Least Privilege
The principle of least privilege means users should only have the minimum access required to perform their tasks.

This reduces:
- Accidental system changes
- Malware impact
- Privilege abuse

---

## NTFS Permissions
NTFS permissions control access to files and folders.

Common permissions include:
- Read
- Write
- Modify
- Full Control

Incorrect permissions can allow unauthorized access or data tampering.

---

## User Account Control (UAC)
UAC is a Windows security feature that prompts for approval before allowing administrative actions.

UAC helps prevent:
- Silent privilege escalation
- Unauthorized system changes

---

## Why Permissions Matter for Security
Many attacks rely on:
- Weak permissions
- Excessive privileges
- Users running as administrators

Proper permission management limits attacker movement and damage.
