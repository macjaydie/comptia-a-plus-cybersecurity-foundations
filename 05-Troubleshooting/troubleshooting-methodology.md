# Troubleshooting Methodology



Troubleshooting is a structured process used to diagnose and solve technical problems efficiently. The CompTIA A+ methodology follows six clear steps.



---



## Step 1: Identify the Problem



Gather information from the user and observe symptoms.



Examples:

- Ask what changed before the issue started

- Check for error messages

- Determine if the issue is consistent or intermittent



---



## Step 2: Establish a Theory of Probable Cause



Use the information collected to form a possible explanation.



Examples:

- A computer not turning on could be a power supply issue

- Slow performance may be caused by low memory or malware



---



## Step 3: Test the Theory



Verify whether your theory is correct.



Examples:

- Swap the power cable

- Run antivirus software

- Restart services



If the theory is not confirmed, create a new theory and test again.



---



## Step 4: Establish a Plan of Action and Implement the Solution



Once the cause is known, determine the best way to fix it.



Examples:

- Replace faulty hardware

- Reinstall drivers

- Remove malware



---



## Step 5: Verify Full System Functionality



After fixing the issue, confirm everything works properly.



Examples:

- Restart the system

- Test affected applications

- Ask the user to confirm the issue is resolved



---



## Step 6: Document Findings, Actions, and Outcomes



Documentation is essential for future reference and knowledge sharing.



Include:

- The problem

- Steps taken

- Final resolution
