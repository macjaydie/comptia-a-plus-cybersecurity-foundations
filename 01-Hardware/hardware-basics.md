\# Hardware Basics



This document covers the core physical components that make up a computer system. Understanding hardware is important in cybersecurity because attackers often exploit hardware weaknesses, and defenders must understand how systems function at a basic level.

\## Central Processing Unit (CPU)



The CPU is the "brain" of the computer. It processes instructions from programs and the operating system.



Key points:

\- Performs calculations and executes commands

\- Affects system speed and performance

\- Modern CPUs include security features like virtualization support and hardware-based protections



---



\## Random Access Memory (RAM)



RAM is temporary memory used to store data that the CPU needs quickly.



Key points:

\- Volatile memory (data is lost when power is off)

\- More RAM allows better multitasking

\- Malware and attackers may run processes in memory, making RAM important in forensic investigations

\## Storage Devices



Storage devices keep data permanently.



\### Hard Disk Drive (HDD)

\- Uses spinning disks

\- Slower but cheaper

\- More prone to physical damage



\### Solid State Drive (SSD)

\- No moving parts

\- Faster and more reliable

\- Common in modern systems



Security relevance:

\- Drives can be encrypted to protect data

\- Data recovery may be possible if drives are not securely wiped

\## Motherboard



The motherboard connects all hardware components together.



Key points:

\- Houses CPU, RAM, and expansion slots

\- Contains firmware (BIOS/UEFI)

\- Physical access to the motherboard can allow hardware attacks



---



\## Power Supply Unit (PSU)



The PSU provides power to all components.



Key points:

\- Converts electricity from wall outlet to usable power

\- Insufficient or failing power supplies can cause system instability or hardware damage



---



\## Peripherals



Peripherals are external devices connected to a computer.



Examples:

\- Keyboard and mouse

\- Monitor

\- USB devices

\- Printers



Security relevance:

\- USB devices can introduce malware

\- Unauthorized devices can be used to exfiltrate data

\## Why Hardware Knowledge Matters in Cybersecurity



Understanding hardware helps defenders:

\- Recognize physical security risks

\- Understand device-based attacks (e.g., malicious USB devices)

\- Support investigations involving seized equipment

\- Make informed decisions about system hardening
