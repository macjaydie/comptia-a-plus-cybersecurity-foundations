# The CIA Triad



The CIA Triad represents the three core principles of cybersecurity: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. These principles guide how systems and data should be protected.

## Confidentiality



Confidentiality ensures that sensitive information is only accessible to authorized users.



Examples:

- Password protection

- Encryption

- Access controls



---



## Integrity



Integrity ensures that data is accurate and has not been altered without authorization.



Examples:

- File hashing

- Digital signatures

- Access restrictions



---



## Availability



Availability ensures that systems and data are accessible when needed.



Examples:

- Backups

- Redundant systems

- Protection against DDoS attacks

## Why the CIA Triad Matters



All security controls aim to protect one or more parts of the CIA Triad. Security professionals use this model to evaluate risks and defenses.
