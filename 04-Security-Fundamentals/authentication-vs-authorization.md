# Authentication vs Authorization



Authentication and authorization are core concepts in access control and system security.



---



## Authentication



Authentication verifies a user’s identity.



Examples:

- Passwords

- PINs

- Biometrics

- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)



---



## Authorization



Authorization determines what an authenticated user is allowed to do.



Examples:

- Access to files

- Application permissions

- Administrative rights



---



## Why the Difference Matters



A user may be authenticated but still not authorized to access certain resources. Proper access control depends on both processes.
